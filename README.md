# Machine Learning

### Introduction
In this repository I bring nice discussion on machine learning models which are commonly used in this field. This repository will be updated every often to have more and new codes. 

### Available codes
* Ensemble_Methods.ipynb
  This notebook talks about Ensemble Methods such as Random Forests, Extremly Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Trees.
  
### Required packages:
* [graphviz](https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/)
* [skelrean packages](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
  * [Decision Trees](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)
  * [Random Forests](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
  * [ExtraTreesClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier) is used to categorical data and the 
  * [ExtraTreesRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor)
  * [Train Test split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html)
  * [Gradient Boosting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-boosting)
